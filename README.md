# customer-management
Simple Java Web demonstration for MVC and REST technology, without using Spring framework.

## Motivation
When I started learning Java Web, I read a blog that says it's better to learn Java Web from the basic servlet, rather than some framework which did all the work behind the scene. This way you can learn how things are done and have a better understanding of the technology. I have learned the Spring framework by then and followed along the tutorial. But I still get the feeling that it's a black box. Therefore, in this project, I'm going to build a very simple customer management system from the scratch. If you are also a begginer of Java Web development, I hope this project can help you understand some basic concept of the technology. 

## Background Knowledge   
In this project, I am going to use the following technology:

- Servlet
- Restful API design
- MVC design
- HTML/javascript/jquery
- Ajax
- MySQL
- JDBC

For most of these technologies, you can find tutorials in [Tutorialspoint](https://www.tutorialspoint.com).

## PS
This is my first "serious" project on Github. I decided to learn Java Web development not long ago and I thought it's time for me to build something and learn from this process. This project is inspired by @codingXiaxw 's [blog post](http://codingxiaxw.cn) and [project](https://github.com/codingXiaxw/CustomerManagement). I added Restful design into this project. In the meantime I didn't use JSP technology as my View layer because I think JSP is a little bit outdated and personally I think it's ugly and I simply don't want to learn it. But that's just my personal thought. Maybe I will learn it in the future if necessary. I am following the learning path provided by @codingXiaxw. If you know Chinese, I recommand you to read that inspiring [post](http://codingxiaxw.cn/2017/11/21/69-the-words-want-to-say/).  

I use English here not because I want to ZhuangBi, but because I am going to Sweden this year and I really need to practice my English in all ways :-)
